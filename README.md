## 📊 Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of insurance data, revealing critical insights into the relationships between demographics, health metrics, and insurance costs. Through sophisticated statistical analysis and compelling visualizations, we examine how factors like gender, BMI, age, and lifestyle choices impact healthcare expenses.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Demographic Analysis**: Compare insurance patterns across gender groups
- **Health Metrics**: Examine BMI distributions and categorizations
- **Cost Patterns**: Identify factors influencing insurance charges
- **Behavioral Insights**: Analyze smoking prevalence and regional variations

## 📁 Dataset Structure

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `age` | Age of the insured individual | Numeric |
| `sex` | Gender (male/female) | Categorical |
| `bmi` | Body Mass Index | Numeric |
| `children` | Number of dependents | Numeric |
| `smoker` | Smoking status | Categorical |
| `region` | Residential area | Categorical |
| `charges` | Insurance costs | Numeric |

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Data Preprocessing Pipeline
- **Smart Imputation**: Handles missing values using statistical mean imputation
- **Intelligent Sorting**: Organizes data by BMI for streamlined analysis
- **Strategic Grouping**: Segments data by gender for comparative insights

### 📏 BMI Classification System

```python
Underweight    → BMI < 18.5
Normal Weight  → 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25.0
Overweight     → 25.0 ≤ BMI < 30.0
Obese          → BMI ≥ 30.0
```

### 📈 Statistical Analysis

- ✓ Gender-based smoking prevalence rates
- ✓ Regional distribution analysis
- ✓ BMI category frequency distributions
- ✓ Comparative demographic metrics
